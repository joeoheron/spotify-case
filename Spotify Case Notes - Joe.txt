(Case Notes)
Piracy
Storage
* physical vs. digital
	* owned vs. subscribed

Zune, iPod. Walkman-devices

Competitors
* Apple, Amazon, Soundcloud, Podcast apps, other media?

From 125000 → 40000000 song libraries

Major Labels try their hand with Music Net and Pressplay
* Labeled as some of the worst tech products of all time

iTunes profits weren’t significant
* Acted as more of a loss leader, with iPods having greater margin and being more important to bottom line

Sony Connect and Zune Marketplace
* These came with certain compatibility requirements

DRM was abandoned due to Amazon's entry into the market

Radiohead attempted a choose your price with one of their albums, selling direct to listeners

Rhapsody music streaming

Pandora, Slacker, Tidal

Data access: storage space available on hardware vs. data limitations from networks

Streaming bigger than downloads by 2017

Global
* Spotify was in Europe for 3 years before moving into US market
* By 2020, they were present in 85 different countries
* There’s been some difficulty with emerging markets
	* Piracy
	* How much do they consider purchasing power in their pricing and monetization strategies?
* Equity swap with Tencent
	* Allowed more significant access to Chinese market

Business Model
* Freemium
* What differentiates them from competitors at this point?
* The average revenue per user is at €4.31 and has been in decline lately

Extras
* Spotify recognizes and leverages the importance of playlists
* They’ve provided an ability to follow friends
* Spotify for Artists provides a space for artists to see more data about their music and listeners

Half of Spotify’s employees are in R&D

Sales more expensive in free version
* Does the general public suffer from subscription fatigue?
	* The case shows free users accelerating at greater rate than paid
	* Have they reached a plateau percentage of paid users?
Royalties represent the biggest cost of the business

Taylor Swift left Spotify, then came back

Spotify briefly offered publishing abilities for artists in their Spotify for Artists offering, then backtracked on that

Self publishing has been on the rise

Two-thirds of the label market is controlled by only 3 major labels
* Signing a new artist and working with them can cost between $500000-2m

How significant is the matter of new music discovery vs. listening to the same tracks over and over?

The Apple App Store charges a 30% fee on app transactions, causing issues for Spotify

Spotify introduced a hifi plan that would be more expensive than its other plans, where competitors were willing to offer hifi for free

YouTube holds the largest portion of the free music streaming market

Wasn’t podcast data notoriously difficult to collect, analyse and derive insights?

When do losses matter to investors?

Spotify aims to have billions of users, how well does that balance with increasing premium costs and inability to earn more from free users?

What role does Spotify play in live show ticket sales?

Summarise

Timing plays a role here, not necessarily the first mover, but they were an early mover.

User experience has been a critical component of their success.

Piracy has had a major influence on the industry.

Who’s all involved here?
* Spotify. Record Labels, Artists, Users (paid vs. free)

E

I-competitive tech, royalties, labels, low earnings-high cost free plan

(Research Paper Notes)
Value Capture Problem
* Requires understanding platforms and ecosystems
	* labels, piracy, artists, physical vs. digital, download vs. stream
* There’s an amplified difficulty for capturing value for enabling technologies
	* Is Spotify an enabling technology?
		* I don’t think so.
	* It’s difficult and impractical control/own all products that get built on top of an enabling technology
* Enabling technologies need complementary assets
	* What are these in audio?
		* podcasts, live shows (horizontal)
		* producing and publishing (vertical)
* Complementors lead to coordination and market design challenges
	* How does this apply to the case?
		* Spotify decided to remove self-publishing and leaned more into horizontal
	* Greater social than private returns causes failure

Profiting from Innovation (PFI)
* Must find and consider this framework
* What is “industry architecture” (Jacobides et al) as mentioned in the research?

Why do pioneering firms often fail to capture much of the economic returns from innovation?
* iPod vs. the first MP3
* Is Spotify the iPod or the first MP3?
* "incremental/imitative entrants" are more likely to take market share than something radical

The social returns of research and development are 2x the private returns

What does research and development spillover mean and how does it apply to this case?

How important is appropriability (low vs. high) in Spotify’s case?

The paper mentions that a large portfolio of patents can prove valuable for cross licensing deals with rivals
* Is this exemplified in the Spotify case somehow? Does it matter?

General Purpose Technologies (GPT)
1. Pervasive-widely used
2. Capable of ongoing tech improvement
3. Enable complementary innovations in application sectors
* examples: electricity, the printing press

Enabling Technologies
* Meets criteria 2 & 3 above
* examples: 3G/4G
* Artificial intelligence is mentioned in the paper, but perhaps this is a GPT now?
	* Out of scope of case, but how similar is the OpenAI case for lack of profitability?

What do spillovers represent in this paper and in this case?
* Are there both dynamic and static examples applicable here?

Adoption is critical to the improvement of a technology
* What does coordination look like with major labels?

Does venture capital/private investment pick up the pieces where policy falls short?

What is full appropriation?

"... capturing value from enabling technologies is more challenging, from a business model standpoint, than capturing value from a modest discrete innovation."

Potential presentation activity could be polling the class to “Put your hand up if you believe Spotify is one of the worst technologies ever.”

MPEG-is this an enabling technology within the case? What does MPEG stand for again?

Profiting from innovation says that profits go to bottleneck assets within ecosystems
* These may shift over time
* What makes a bottleneck asset?
* example: data rate increases may raise profits of video content providers while imposing greater cost on network provider
	* fortune of specific types of content will face different appropriability regimes
		* Netflix mentioned in research for video, but what about audio?
			* Bad Bunny vs a stranger's mixtape

Five Drivers of Profiting from Innovation
1. Appropriability Regime
2. Complementary Assets/Tech and Related Business Model Issues
3. Standards and Installed Base Effects
	a. What does that mean? Is it relevant here?
4. Timing
5. Ecosystem Strength

Is music distribution a bottleneck asset? Is it production?

Ecosystems that Spotify Operates Within
* music
* mobile technology
* cloud technology
* podcasts

**Dynamic Capabilities Framework**

Tight integration is an advantage.

Is high-fidelity an example of progression in audio focused enabling
technology?
